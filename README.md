# deep_soli
This is an attempt to train the model using deep soli (google) data provided by ETH group: you can find details about dataset here:

This project uses Google's [Project Soli](atap.google.com/soli) sensor.

> Soli is a new sensing technology that uses miniature radar to
> detect touchless gesture interactions.

> Soli sensor technology works by emitting electromagnetic waves in a
> broad beam. Objects within the beam scatter this energy, reflecting
> some portion back towards the radar antenna. Properties of the
> reflected signal, such as energy, time delay, and frequency shift
> capture rich information about the objectâ€™s characteristics and
> dynamics, including size, shape, orientation, material, distance,
> and velocity.
